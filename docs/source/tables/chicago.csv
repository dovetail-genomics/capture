\--design-dir,,Path to the design directory
\--cutoff,5,Score threshold for calling significant interactions (typically set to  5). Scores are calculated as -log weighted p-values based on the expected true positive rates at different distance ranges (estimated from data). Increasing the cutoff will increase the stringency and less interactions will be called.
\--export-format,,Multiple formats are available for exporting the interactions. You can specify multiple formats to be used. We recommend the following:
,interBed,"Each interaction detailed as one row with the following fields: bait_chr\, bait_start\,  bait_end\, bait_name\, otherEnd_chr\, otherEnd_start\,  otherEnd_end\,  otherEnd_name\,  N_reads\,  and score"
,washU_text,Can be read by the WashU browser. Upload to the browser using: **Tracks** → **Local Text Tracks** → **long-range text**
,washU_track,"Can be read by the WashU browser. Upload to the browser using"" **Tracks** → **Local Tracks** → **longrange** (both track file and index file should be uploaded)"
,seqMonk,"Each interaction is represented by two rows: bait row followed by other-end row. Includes the following fields: chromosome\, start\, end\, name\, number of reads and interaction score"
<path_to_chinput>,,"Path to chinput file(s). If you wish to run CHiCAGO on multiple replicas together, you can specify multiple chinput files ( in a comma separated format). All the chinput files should be made using the same settings and with thesame rmap and baitmap files located in the specified design directory"
