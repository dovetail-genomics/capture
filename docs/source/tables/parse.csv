"Parameter	",Value,Function
min-mapq,40,Mapq threshold for defining an alignment as a multi-mapping alignment. Alignment with mapq <40 will be marked as type M (multi)
walks-policy,5unique,"Walks is the term used to describe multiple ligations events, resulting three alignments (instead of two) for a read pair. However, there are cases in which three alignment in read pairs are the result of one ligation event, pairtool parse can rescue this event. walks-policy is the policy for reporting un-rescuable walk. 5unique is used to report the 5’-most unique alignment on each side, if present (one or both sides may map to different locations on the genome, producing more than two alignments per DNA molecule)"
max-inter-align-gap,30,"In cases where there is a gap between alignments, if the gap is 30 or smaller, ignore the gap, if the gap is >30bp, mark as ""null"" alignment"
nproc-in,"integer, e.g. 16","pairtools has an automatic-guess function to identify the format of the input file, whether it is compressed or not. When needed, the input is decompressed by bgzip/lz4c. The option nproc-in set the number of processes used by the auto-guessed input decompressing command, if not specified, default is 3"
nproc-out,"integer, e.g. 16","pairtools automatic-guess the desired format of the output file (compressed or not compressed, based on file name extension). When needed, the output is compressed by bgzip/lz4c. The option nproc-out set the number of processes used by the auto-guessed output compressing command, if not specified, default is 8"
chroms-path,,"path to .genome file, e.g. hg38.genome"
\*.sam,,path to sam file used as an input. If you are piping the input (stdin) skip this option
\*pairsam,,name of pairsam file for writing output results. You can choose to skip and pipe the output directly to the next commad (pairtools sort)
