"Parameter	",Value,Function
min-mapq,40,Mapq threshold for defining an alignment as a multi-mapping alignment. Alignment with mapq < 40 will be marked as type M (multi)
walks-policy,5unique,"Walks is the term used to describe multiple ligation events resulting in three alignments (instead of two) for a read pair. However, in cases where three alignments arise from a single ligation event, pairtools parse can rescue this event. Walks-policy defines the policy for reporting un-rescuable walks. The 5unique value is used to report the 5’-most unique alignment on each side, if present (one or both sides may map to different locations on the genome, producing more than two alignments per DNA molecule)"
max-inter-align-gap,30,"In cases where there is a gap between alignments, if the gap is 30 or smaller the algorithm will, ignore the gap, and for gaps  >30 bp, these will be marked as ""null"" alignments"
nproc-in,"integer, e.g. 16","Pairtools has an automatic ""guesses"" function to identify the format of the input file, whether it is compressed or not. When needed, the input is decompressed by bgzip/lz4c. The option nproc-in sets the number of processes used by the auto-guess input decompressing function.If not specified the default is 3."
nproc-out,"integer, e.g. 16","Pairtools automatically ""guesses"" the desired output file format (compressed or not compressed, based on file name extension). When needed, the output is compressed by bgzip/lz4c. The option nproc-out sets the number of processes used by the auto-guess output compressing function. If not specified the default is 8"
chroms-path,,Defines the path to your .genome file (e.g. hg38.genome)
\*.sam,,Defines the path to the sam file used as an input. If you are piping the input (stdin) skip this option
\*pairsam,,Name of pairsam file for writing output results. You can choose to skip and pipe the output directly to the next command (pairtools sort)
