Parameter,Function
\-Xmx,"The flag Xmx specifies the maximum memory allocation pool for a Java virtual machine, from our experience 48000m works well when processing human data sets. If you are not sure how much memory your system has, run the command ``free -h`` and check the value under `total`."
Djava.awt.headless=true,"Java is ran in a headless mode when the application does not interact with a user (if not specified\, the default is Djava.awt.headless=false)"
eigenvector,The eigenvector command is used to calculate the first principal component of the Pearson's Observed/Expected matrix
\-p,"Optional, force with curren parameters. When running with resolution < 500kb this may take very long time and by default the run will be canceled (output file will be empty). To force the run with any resolution < 500kb use the `-p` flag"
VC/VC_SQRT/KR,Normalization to be used. KR (Knight-Ruiz) balancing is recommended.
\*.hic,"hic input file\, containing the contact matrix"
chr,"The chromosome for which the principle component will be calculated (make sure that same format as in the reference is used, e.g. `chrX` or `x`, depending on the reference)"
output directory,"a path to the directory in which a bedpe file containing the contact domains will be saved (the name of the file is composed of the resolution followed by `_blocks.bedpe`). The bedpe file, is a text file with 16 fields in each row. For more details on the file format,  see the :ref:`table<TFORMAT>` below"
BP,"resolution type (FRAG is another resolution type, this option is not covered in this documentation) "
Resolution,Which resolution to be used for the calculation (integer). Since the goal here is to identify high level compartments  1M (100000) or 500k (500000) are typically sufficient
Output file,"Name of text file for recording the calculated values. The output is a list of eigenvalues recorede for each bin, sorted by order on the chromosome. E.g. if the chromosome lenght 43Mb and a bin size of 1000000 was used, the output will be a list of 43 eigenvalues in text  format."
